This repository contains a small [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application that shows how to implement a basic REST API.

# Running the application

To start the application (i.e. to start the web server) you have several options:

* On the command line (you need to have installed [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)):

     * Run script `maven_run.bat` in Window's *cmd.exe* ("DOS Box").

     * Enter the following command (starts goal `run` of plugin `spring-boot`):
       > mvn spring-boot:run

  <br>

See [this page in the Wiki for this repository](https://github.com/MDecker-MobileComputing/Java_RestApi_SpringBoot/wiki/Maven-in-Eclipse)
on how to define a *Run Configuration* for running Maven goal `spring-boot:run` in **Eclipse IDE**.
