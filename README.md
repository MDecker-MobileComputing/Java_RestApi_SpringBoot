# Rest-API with Spring Boot

This repository contains a small [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application that shows how to implement a basic REST API.

# Running the application

To start the application (i.e. to start the web server) you have several options:

* On the command line:

     * Run script `maven_run.bat` in Windows cmd.exe ("DOS-Box")

     * Enter the following command:
       > mvn spring-boot:run

  <br>

* In [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) you can use a run configuration:
